# Java
This repository holds code for the Java classes I have taken at UCCS.
The code ranges from just printing output to the console to manipulating
2D arrays and using stacks, classes and other data structures.

The Text File folder holds the text files used for the CS1450 java files. 
Below you will find which files go to which java files.
